# What's New in LogCal v1.3

## What's New

### Better Weekly View
The weekly chart now uses intuitive colors - green when you're on track, red when you've exceeded your goal. Today's bar is highlighted with a subtle border.

### Redesigned History
Each day is now displayed in its own card, making it easier to browse through your past meals with better spacing and organization.

### Polished Design
Improved dark mode support, consistent icon colors across settings, and smoother interactions throughout the app.

### Bug Fixes
Fixed text overlap issues when logging meals and improved account switching with automatic data refresh.
